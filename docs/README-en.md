# AntiCheat

A Lethal Company anti-cheat mod (host-only)

The default language is Simplified Chinese. You can switch to English by changing the Language to "en_us" in the configuration file.

### Introduction

Discord: https://discord.gg/ZdWr2rKR

This mod is designed to prevent cheating when hosting public lobbies, ensuring a fair gaming experience for all players.

While using this mod, you might encounter false positives, but this may not be an issue with the AntiCheat mod itself. To troubleshoot, please try uninstalling all mods except for BepInEx and AntiCheat, and attempt to reproduce the issue. If the issue no longer occurs, it's likely a compatibility problem with another mod.

### Installation

1. Install [BepInExPack](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/BepInEx/BepInExPack);
2. Place AntiCheat.dll in the Lethal Company\BepInEx\plugins directory;
3. Launch the game. Once the game has started, you can find the configuration file AntiCheat.cfg in the Lethal Company\BepInEx\config directory.

### Creating a Room
By default, the "[AC]" prefix will be added to the lobby name to indicate to other players that the anti-cheat is enabled in this lobby.

Example:
[AC] The battle is thrilling!
